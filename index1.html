      A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and
      are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do
      that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.

    <p>
      This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an
      essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the
      essay and grasp its main points.

      Although most paragraphs should have a topic sentence, there are a few
      situations when a paragraph might not need a topic sentence.

      XAUUSD (Gold/US Dollar) represents the spot price of one troy ounce of
      gold in US dollars, acting as a premier, highly liquid, and volatile
      instrument in the Forex market . Often viewed as a safe-haven asset, its
      price is driven by global economic uncertainty, inflation expectations,
      and geopolitical tensions.

      Trading 24/5, this pair typically exhibits an inverse relationship with
      the US Dollar, often surging when the greenback weakens or during market
      turmoil. It is widely used by traders for hedging against risk and
      capitalizing on market volatility, especially around major economic
      releases like US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) and Federal Reserve interest rate
      decisions.
